# Hi there, I'm Amiel De Los Reyes üëã

## Journey into Software Engineering üöÄ

My journey into the world of coding began in 2017, transitioning from being a dedicated athlete to a relentless problem solver in software development. I thrive on challenges and view every problem as an opportunity to provide ingenious solutions. The Covid-19 pandemic redirected my path, and I embraced the power of software development, discovering a new passion akin to my dedication to basketball.

Discovering the power of software development ignited a new passion in me, reminiscent of my dedication to basketball. I found joy in solving problems through code, and this led me to explore various projects, starting with volunteer work at my local church. From building a Church Management System to participating in hackathons and crafting innovative solutions, I've evolved into a hungry and growth-oriented Software Engineer.
